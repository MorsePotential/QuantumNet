	abstract = {It has been recently shown in Ren et al. (2010) that by collecting noise-contaminated time series generated by a coupled-oscillator system at each node of a network, it is possible to robustly reconstruct its topology, i.e. determine the graph Laplacian. Restricting ourselves to linear consensus dynamics over undirected communication networks, in this paper we introduce a new dynamic average consensus least-squares algorithm to locally estimate these time series at each node, thus making the reconstruction process fully distributed and more easily applicable in the real world. We also propose a novel efficient method for separating the off-diagonal entries of the reconstructed Laplacian, and examine several concepts related to the trace of the dynamic correlation matrix of the coupled single integrators, which is a distinctive element of our network reconstruction method. The theory is illustrated with examples from computer, power and transportation systems.},

A technique is provided guaranteeing an exact detection of the links of a network of dynamical systems with no undirected cycles (Linear Dynamic Polytrees). In particular, the presence of unobserved (latent) nodes is taken into account. Knowledge on the speciﬁc number of hidden processes is not required. It is proven that the topology can be consistently reconstructed, as long the degree of each latent node is at least three with outdegree of at least two. The result extends previous work that was limited to a more restricted class of dynamical systems (Rooted Trees).},

	abstract = {The paper addresses methods for generation of individualized computational domains on the basis of medical imaging dataset. The computational domains will be used in one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D)–1D coupled hemodynamic models. A 1D hemodynamic model employs a 1D network of a patientspeciﬁc vascular network with large number of vessels. The 1D network is the graph with nodes in the 3D space which bears additional geometric data such as length and radius of vessels. A 3D hemodynamic model requires a detailed 3D reconstruction of local parts of the vascular network. We propose algorithms which extend the automated segmentation of vascular and tubular structures, generation of centerlines, 1D network reconstruction, correction, and local adaptation. We consider two modes of centerline representation: (i) skeletal segments or sets of connected voxels and (ii) curved paths with corresponding radii. Individualized reconstruction of 1D networks depends on the mode of centerline representation. Efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on several examples of 1D network reconstruction. The networks can be used in modeling of blood ﬂows as well as other physiological processes in tubular structures. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Accessing the network through which a propagation dynamics diffuse is essential for understanding and controlling it. In a few cases, such information is available through direct experiments or thanks to the very nature of propagation data. In a majority of cases however, available information about the network is indirect and comes from partial observations of the dynamics, rendering the network reconstruction a fundamental inverse problem. Here we show that it is possible to reconstruct the whole structure of an interaction network and to simultaneously infer the complete time course of activation spreading, relying just on single epoch (i.e. snapshot) or time-scattered observations of a small number of activity cascades. The method that we present is built on a Belief Propagation approximation, that has shown impressive accuracy in a wide variety of relevant cases, and is able to infer interactions in presence of incomplete time-series data by providing a detailed modeling of the posterior distribution of trajectories conditioned to the observations. Furthermore, we show by experiments that the information content of full cascades is relatively smaller than that of sparse observations or single snapshots.},

	abstract = {Many complex processes can be viewed as dynamical systems on networks. However, in real cases, only the performances of the system are known, the network structure and the dynamical rules are not observed. Therefore, recovering latent network structure and dynamics from observed time series data are important tasks because it may help us to open the black box, and even to build up the model of a complex system automatically. Although this problem hosts a wealth of potential applications in biology, earth science, and epidemics etc., conventional methods have limitations. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Gumbel Graph Network ({GGN}), which is a model-free, data-driven deep learning framework to accomplish the reconstruction of both network connections and the dynamics on it. Our model consists of two jointly trained parts: a network generator that generating a discrete network with the Gumbel Softmax technique; and a dynamics learner that utilizing the generated network and one-step trajectory value to predict the states in future steps. We exhibit the universality of our framework on different kinds of time-series data: with the same structure, our model can be trained to accurately recover the network structure and predict future states on continuous, discrete, and binary dynamics, and outperforms competing network reconstruction methods.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopic networks ({SNs}), where the vertices are discrete, rovibronic energy levels and the edges are transitions among the levels allowed by quantum mechanics, serve as useful models helping to understand high-resolution spectra of molecular systems. The experimental {SNs} of the (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) molecules, containing a single copy of the known measured and assigned transitions, are investigated via the corresponding network representation matrices, including the Ritz matrix (Formula presented.), the adjacency matrix (Formula presented.), the combinatorial Laplacian matrix (Formula presented.), and the normalized Laplacian matrix (Formula presented.). Using elements of graph (network) theory and the eigenvalue spectra of the matrices mentioned, several interesting results relevant for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy are revealed about the structure of the investigated {SNs}. For example, as long as the parity selection rule of molecular rovibrational transitions is not violated, the experimental {SNs} investigated not only contain, with the exception of (Formula presented.), two principal components but they are all bipartite networks, as proven by the symmetry of the eigenvalue spectrum of (Formula presented.) about the origin. Furthermore, the {PageRank} ordering system is introduced to molecular spectroscopy to identify the most important vertices of {SNs}. The rankings provided by the degree of the levels and by {PageRank} may differ significantly; it appears that {PageRank} provides the more useful ranking. The connectors of relatively dense clusters of the {SNs} are identified and analysed via spectral clustering techniques based on (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.). The identification of connectors becomes especially important when judging the true accuracy of the experimental rovibrational energy levels obtained through the Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels ({MARVEL}) approach, built with the help of the Ritz matrix (Formula presented.). © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopic networks ({SNs}) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles {SNs} are "deterministic" by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these {SNs}, a certain randomness ("stochasticity") is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the {HD} 16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of {SNs}. The degree distribution of realistic computed {SNs} can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental {SNs}, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational-vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The principal advantage of using cycle bases is that outlier transitions –almost always present in spectroscopic databases built from experimental data originating from many different sources– can be detected and identified straightforwardly and automatically. The data available for six water isotopologues, H2 16O, H2 17O, H2 18O, {HD}16O, {HD}17O, and {HD}18O, in the {HITRAN}2012 and {GEISA}2015 databases are used to demonstrate the utility of cycle-basis-based outlier-detection approaches. The spectroscopic databases appear to be sufficiently complete so that the great majority of the entries of the minimum cycle basis have the minimum possible length of four. More than 2000 transition conflicts have been identified for the isotopologue H2 16O in the {HITRAN}2012 database, the seven common conflict types are discussed.

The procedure starts with collecting, critically evaluating, selecting, and compiling all available measured transitions, including assignments and uncertainties, into a single database. Then, spectroscopic networks ({SN}) are determined which contain all interconnecting rotational–vibrational energy levels supported by the grand database of the selected transitions. Adjustment of the uncertainties of the lines is performed next, with the help of a robust weighting strategy, until a self-consistent set of lines and uncertainties is achieved. Inversion of the transitions through a weighted least-squares-type procedure results in {MARVEL} energy levels and associated uncertainties. Local sensitivity coefficients could be computed for each energy level. The resulting set of {MARVEL} levels is called active as when new experimental measurements become available the same evaluation, adjustment, and inversion procedure should be repeated in order to obtain more dependable energy levels and uncertainties. {MARVEL} is tested on the example of the H217O isotopologue of water and a list of 2736 dependable energy levels, based on 8369 transitions, has been obtained.},

Here we present {GraphSAGE}, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},
