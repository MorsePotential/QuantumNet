	abstract = {It has been recently shown in Ren et al. (2010) that by collecting noise-contaminated time series generated by a coupled-oscillator system at each node of a network, it is possible to robustly reconstruct its topology, i.e. determine the graph Laplacian. Restricting ourselves to linear consensus dynamics over undirected communication networks, in this paper we introduce a new dynamic average consensus least-squares algorithm to locally estimate these time series at each node, thus making the reconstruction process fully distributed and more easily applicable in the real world. We also propose a novel efficient method for separating the off-diagonal entries of the reconstructed Laplacian, and examine several concepts related to the trace of the dynamic correlation matrix of the coupled single integrators, which is a distinctive element of our network reconstruction method. The theory is illustrated with examples from computer, power and transportation systems.},

A technique is provided guaranteeing an exact detection of the links of a network of dynamical systems with no undirected cycles (Linear Dynamic Polytrees). In particular, the presence of unobserved (latent) nodes is taken into account. Knowledge on the speciﬁc number of hidden processes is not required. It is proven that the topology can be consistently reconstructed, as long the degree of each latent node is at least three with outdegree of at least two. The result extends previous work that was limited to a more restricted class of dynamical systems (Rooted Trees).},

	abstract = {The paper addresses methods for generation of individualized computational domains on the basis of medical imaging dataset. The computational domains will be used in one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D)–1D coupled hemodynamic models. A 1D hemodynamic model employs a 1D network of a patientspeciﬁc vascular network with large number of vessels. The 1D network is the graph with nodes in the 3D space which bears additional geometric data such as length and radius of vessels. A 3D hemodynamic model requires a detailed 3D reconstruction of local parts of the vascular network. We propose algorithms which extend the automated segmentation of vascular and tubular structures, generation of centerlines, 1D network reconstruction, correction, and local adaptation. We consider two modes of centerline representation: (i) skeletal segments or sets of connected voxels and (ii) curved paths with corresponding radii. Individualized reconstruction of 1D networks depends on the mode of centerline representation. Efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on several examples of 1D network reconstruction. The networks can be used in modeling of blood ﬂows as well as other physiological processes in tubular structures. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Accessing the network through which a propagation dynamics diffuse is essential for understanding and controlling it. In a few cases, such information is available through direct experiments or thanks to the very nature of propagation data. In a majority of cases however, available information about the network is indirect and comes from partial observations of the dynamics, rendering the network reconstruction a fundamental inverse problem. Here we show that it is possible to reconstruct the whole structure of an interaction network and to simultaneously infer the complete time course of activation spreading, relying just on single epoch (i.e. snapshot) or time-scattered observations of a small number of activity cascades. The method that we present is built on a Belief Propagation approximation, that has shown impressive accuracy in a wide variety of relevant cases, and is able to infer interactions in presence of incomplete time-series data by providing a detailed modeling of the posterior distribution of trajectories conditioned to the observations. Furthermore, we show by experiments that the information content of full cascades is relatively smaller than that of sparse observations or single snapshots.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopic networks ({SNs}), where the vertices are discrete, rovibronic energy levels and the edges are transitions among the levels allowed by quantum mechanics, serve as useful models helping to understand high-resolution spectra of molecular systems. The experimental {SNs} of the (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) molecules, containing a single copy of the known measured and assigned transitions, are investigated via the corresponding network representation matrices, including the Ritz matrix (Formula presented.), the adjacency matrix (Formula presented.), the combinatorial Laplacian matrix (Formula presented.), and the normalized Laplacian matrix (Formula presented.). Using elements of graph (network) theory and the eigenvalue spectra of the matrices mentioned, several interesting results relevant for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy are revealed about the structure of the investigated {SNs}. For example, as long as the parity selection rule of molecular rovibrational transitions is not violated, the experimental {SNs} investigated not only contain, with the exception of (Formula presented.), two principal components but they are all bipartite networks, as proven by the symmetry of the eigenvalue spectrum of (Formula presented.) about the origin. Furthermore, the {PageRank} ordering system is introduced to molecular spectroscopy to identify the most important vertices of {SNs}. The rankings provided by the degree of the levels and by {PageRank} may differ significantly; it appears that {PageRank} provides the more useful ranking. The connectors of relatively dense clusters of the {SNs} are identified and analysed via spectral clustering techniques based on (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.). The identification of connectors becomes especially important when judging the true accuracy of the experimental rovibrational energy levels obtained through the Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels ({MARVEL}) approach, built with the help of the Ritz matrix (Formula presented.). © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopic networks ({SNs}) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles {SNs} are "deterministic" by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these {SNs}, a certain randomness ("stochasticity") is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the {HD} 16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of {SNs}. The degree distribution of realistic computed {SNs} can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental {SNs}, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational-vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Cycle bases of graph theory are introduced for the analysis of transition data deposited in line-by-line rovibronic spectroscopic databases. The principal advantage of using cycle bases is that outlier transitions –almost always present in spectroscopic databases built from experimental data originating from many different sources– can be detected and identified straightforwardly and automatically. The data available for six water isotopologues, H2 16O, H2 17O, H2 18O, {HD}16O, {HD}17O, and {HD}18O, in the {HITRAN}2012 and {GEISA}2015 databases are used to demonstrate the utility of cycle-basis-based outlier-detection approaches. The spectroscopic databases appear to be sufficiently complete so that the great majority of the entries of the minimum cycle basis have the minimum possible length of four. More than 2000 transition conflicts have been identified for the isotopologue H2 16O in the {HITRAN}2012 database, the seven common conflict types are discussed. It is recommended to employ cycle bases, and especially a minimum cycle basis, for the analysis of transitions deposited in high-resolution spectroscopic databases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The procedure starts with collecting, critically evaluating, selecting, and compiling all available measured transitions, including assignments and uncertainties, into a single database. Then, spectroscopic networks ({SN}) are determined which contain all interconnecting rotational–vibrational energy levels supported by the grand database of the selected transitions. Adjustment of the uncertainties of the lines is performed next, with the help of a robust weighting strategy, until a self-consistent set of lines and uncertainties is achieved. Inversion of the transitions through a weighted least-squares-type procedure results in {MARVEL} energy levels and associated uncertainties. Local sensitivity coefficients could be computed for each energy level. The resulting set of {MARVEL} levels is called active as when new experimental measurements become available the same evaluation, adjustment, and inversion procedure should be repeated in order to obtain more dependable energy levels and uncertainties. {MARVEL} is tested on the example of the H217O isotopologue of water and a list of 2736 dependable energy levels, based on 8369 transitions, has been obtained.},

Here we present {GraphSAGE}, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks ({GNNs}) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks.

	shorttitle = {Semi-Supervised Graph Classification},
	abstract = {Node classification and graph classification are two graph learning problems that predict the class label of a node and the class label of a graph respectively. A node of a graph usually represents a real-world entity, e.g., a user in a social network, or a protein in a protein-protein interaction network. In this work, we consider a more challenging but practically useful setting, in which a node itself is a graph instance. This leads to a hierarchical graph perspective which arises in many domains such as social network, biological network and document collection. For example, in a social network, a group of people with shared interests forms a user group, whereas a number of user groups are interconnected via interactions or common members. We study the node classification problem in the hierarchical graph where a `node' is a graph instance, e.g., a user group in the above example. As labels are usually limited in real-world data, we design two novel semi-supervised solutions named {\textbackslash}underline\{{SE}\}mi-supervised gr{\textbackslash}underline\{A\}ph c{\textbackslash}underline\{L\}assification via {\textbackslash}underline\{C\}autious/{\textbackslash}underline\{A\}ctive {\textbackslash}underline\{I\}teration (or {SEAL}-C/{AI} in short). {SEAL}-C/{AI} adopt an iterative framework that takes turns to build or update two classifiers, one working at the graph instance level and the other at the hierarchical graph level. To simplify the representation of the hierarchical graph, we propose a novel supervised, self-attentive graph embedding method called {SAGE}, which embeds graph instances of arbitrary size into fixed-length vectors. Through experiments on synthetic data and Tencent {QQ} group data, we demonstrate that {SEAL}-C/{AI} not only outperform competing methods by a significant margin in terms of accuracy/Macro-F1, but also generate meaningful interpretations of the learned representations.},

	abstract = {Deep generative models for graph-structured data offer a new angle on the problem of chemical synthesis: by optimizing differentiable models that directly generate molecular graphs, it is possible to side-step expensive search procedures in the discrete and vast space of chemical structures. We introduce {MolGAN}, an implicit, likelihood-free generative model for small molecular graphs that circumvents the need for expensive graph matching procedures or node ordering heuristics of previous likelihood-based methods. Our method adapts generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) to operate directly on graph-structured data. We combine our approach with a reinforcement learning objective to encourage the generation of molecules with specific desired chemical properties. In experiments on the {QM}9 chemical database, we demonstrate that our model is capable of generating close to 100\% valid compounds. {MolGAN} compares favorably both to recent proposals that use string-based ({SMILES}) representations of molecules and to a likelihood-based method that directly generates graphs, albeit being susceptible to mode collapse.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03324},
	abstract = {Graphs are fundamental data structures which concisely capture the relational structure in many important real-world domains, such as knowledge graphs, physical and social interactions, language, and chemistry. Here we introduce a powerful new approach for learning generative models over graphs, which can capture both their structure and attributes. Our approach uses graph neural networks to express probabilistic dependencies among a graph's nodes and edges, and can, in principle, learn distributions over any arbitrary graph. In a series of experiments our results show that once trained, our models can generate good quality samples of both synthetic graphs as well as real molecular graphs, both unconditionally and conditioned on data. Compared to baselines that do not use graph-structured representations, our models often perform far better. We also explore key challenges of learning generative models of graphs, such as how to handle symmetries and ordering of elements during the graph generation process, and offer possible solutions. Our work is the first and most general approach for learning generative models over arbitrary graphs, and opens new directions for moving away from restrictions of vector- and sequence-like knowledge representations, toward more expressive and flexible relational data structures.},

We pose the problem of graph generation as learning the distribution of biased random walks over the input graph. The proposed model is based on a stochastic neural network that generates discrete output samples and is trained using the Wasserstein {GAN} objective. {NetGAN} is able to produce graphs that exhibit well-known network patterns without explicitly specifying them in the model definition. At the same time, our model exhibits strong generalization properties, as highlighted by its competitive link prediction performance, despite not being trained specifically for this task. Being the first approach to combine both of these desirable properties, {NetGAN} opens exciting avenues for further research.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08773},
	shorttitle = {{GraphRNN}},
	abstract = {Modeling and generating graphs is fundamental for studying networks in biology, engineering, and social sciences. However, modeling complex distributions over graphs and then efficiently sampling from these distributions is challenging due to the non-unique, high-dimensional nature of graphs and the complex, non-local dependencies that exist between edges in a given graph. Here we propose {GraphRNN}, a deep autoregressive model that addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs with minimal assumptions about their structure. {GraphRNN} learns to generate graphs by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure generated so far. In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of {GraphRNN}, we introduce a benchmark suite of datasets, baselines and novel evaluation metrics based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy, which measure distances between sets of graphs. Our experiments show that {GraphRNN} significantly outperforms all baselines, learning to generate diverse graphs that match the structural characteristics of a target set, while also scaling to graphs 50 times larger than previous deep models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01433},
	abstract = {From just a glance, humans can make rich predictions about the future state of a wide range of physical systems. On the other hand, modern approaches from engineering, robotics, and graphics are often restricted to narrow domains and require direct measurements of the underlying states. We introduce the Visual Interaction Network, a general-purpose model for learning the dynamics of a physical system from raw visual observations. Our model consists of a perceptual front-end based on convolutional neural networks and a dynamics predictor based on interaction networks. Through joint training, the perceptual front-end learns to parse a dynamic visual scene into a set of factored latent object representations. The dynamics predictor learns to roll these states forward in time by computing their interactions and dynamics, producing a predicted physical trajectory of arbitrary length. We found that from just six input video frames the Visual Interaction Network can generate accurate future trajectories of hundreds of time steps on a wide range of physical systems. Our model can also be applied to scenes with invisible objects, inferring their future states from their effects on the visible objects, and can implicitly infer the unknown mass of objects. Our results demonstrate that the perceptual module and the object-based dynamics predictor module can induce factored latent representations that support accurate dynamical predictions. This work opens new opportunities for model-based decision-making and planning from raw sensory observations in complex physical environments.},

	abstract = {Interacting systems are prevalent in nature, from dynamical systems in physics to complex societal dynamics. The interplay of components can give rise to complex behavior, which can often be explained using a simple model of the system's constituent parts. In this work, we introduce the neural relational inference ({NRI}) model: an unsupervised model that learns to infer interactions while simultaneously learning the dynamics purely from observational data. Our model takes the form of a variational auto-encoder, in which the latent code represents the underlying interaction graph and the reconstruction is based on graph neural networks. In experiments on simulated physical systems, we show that our {NRI} model can accurately recover ground-truth interactions in an unsupervised manner. We further demonstrate that we can find an interpretable structure and predict complex dynamics in real motion capture and sports tracking data.},

	abstract = {Many complex processes can be viewed as dynamical systems on networks. However, in real cases, only the performances of the system are known, the network structure and the dynamical rules are not observed. Therefore, recovering latent network structure and dynamics from observed time series data are important tasks because it may help us to open the black box, and even to build up the model of a complex system automatically. Although this problem hosts a wealth of potential applications in biology, earth science, and epidemics etc., conventional methods have limitations. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Gumbel Graph Network ({GGN}), which is a model-free, data-driven deep learning framework to accomplish the reconstruction of both network connections and the dynamics on it. Our model consists of two jointly trained parts: a network generator that generating a discrete network with the Gumbel Softmax technique; and a dynamics learner that utilizing the generated network and one-step trajectory value to predict the states in future steps. We exhibit the universality of our framework on different kinds of time-series data: with the same structure, our model can be trained to accurately recover the network structure and predict future states on continuous, discrete, and binary dynamics, and outperforms competing network reconstruction methods.},
